The Prisma Cloud Workload Protection APIs enable both automation and integration.
Use the REST APIs to set up, configure, reconfigure, and deploy Prisma Cloud Compute components that enable you to secure your host, container, and serverless computing environments against vulnerabilities, malware, and compliance violations.
You can also use it to extract data and integrate it with monitoring, alerting, and other systems in your environment.

The Compute APIs are the same for both the Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition (SaaS) and the  Prisma Cloud Compute Edition (self-hosted). The method of accessing the API is slightly different, see [getting started](https://prisma.pan.dev/docs/cloud/cwpp/cwpp-gs) for information on how to access the APIs. 
For important differences in the API across major releases, see the [porting guide](https://prisma.pan.dev/docs/cloud/cwpp/porting-guides/porting-guide-21-08).
