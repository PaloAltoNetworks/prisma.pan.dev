Prisma™ Cloud is a cloud security posture management (CSPM) and cloud workload protection platform
(CWPP) that provides comprehensive visibility and threat detection across an organization’s hybrid,
multi-cloud infrastructure. Prisma Cloud is available as either an 
[Enterprise or Compute Edition](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/welcome/pcee_vs_pcce.html). 
The APIs that you use will depend on the edition that you're using.

Prisma Cloud Platform has a REST API that enables you configure custom integrations for your cloud security
needs. You can, for example, use it to automate sending alert notifications to an in-house tool you
use or to extend the DevOps security capabilities for a tool that does not have an extension or
plugin for Prisma Cloud. Most actions supported on the Prisma Cloud web interface are available with
the REST API. 

Prisma Cloud Compute also offers a REST API. It enables automation and integration with other
systems in your environment. Every control in the Console UI is exposed through the RESTful API. You
can use the API for setup, configuration, monitoring, alerting, and data extaction.
