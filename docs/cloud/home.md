## Welcome to Prisma Cloud!

Prisma Cloud is a cloud native security platform that provides comprehensive visibility, threat prevention, compliance assurance and data protection consistently across the entire lifecycle of software and infrastructure delivery for an organization in hybrid, multi-cloud environments. 

This site describes the APIs you can use to automate your usage of the following Prisma Cloud modules:

* **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**
  Leverages data from public service providers to deliver continuous visibility, security policy
  compliance and threat detection across cloud resources, users, data and applications. This
  includes the APIs that enable you to add cloud accounts, monitor cloud security posture, enable
  data classification and malware scanning on public cloud storage, detect and respond to threats,
  and maintain compliance. It includes the Visibility, Compliance, and Governance APIs, Data
  Security, and IaC Scan APIs.

* **Cloud Workload Protection (CWPP)**
  Helps secure cloud native applications across the application lifecycle, defined by the
  requirement to protect hosts (VMs), containers and serverless from a single console.


For information about Prisma Cloud beyond its APIs, such as administration and policy management,
see the [Prisma Cloud administration documentation](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud.html).
